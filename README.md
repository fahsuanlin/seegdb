# SEEGdb: SEEG database

Stereo-encephalography (SEEG) is the method to invasively record neuronal population activity via electrode implanation in medically refractory epilepsy patient. SEEG offers the unprecedented spatiotemporal resolution of neuronal activity recording. 

This project aims at providing a comprehensive accesss to SEEG data across all patients. Specifically, an interface linking between the electrode locations and data is created.

## Data

Data were EEG time series collected inside a 3T MRI scanner (Skyra, Siemens). EEG were sampled by a 32-channel systemm (Brain Products) with electrodes arranged by the international 10-20 standard. EEG were sampled at 5,000 Hz.
